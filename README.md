# LangGraph_for_Agentic_AI
This repository is a comprehensive guide and practical implementation space for mastering Agentic AI systems using LangGraph , from foundational concepts to real-world multi-agent deployments.

LangGraph is a powerful framework built on top of LangChain that allows you to create graph-based, stateful, and multi-agent AI workflows. Itâ€™s ideal for designing agents that can make decisions, use tools, manage memory, and collaborate with other agents.

 What Repo Contain : 
--> Basics of LangGraph: nodes, edges, state handling

--> Tool-using agents: calculators, search APIs, custom tools

--> Memory integration: short-term, long-term, vector-based

--> Multi-agent systems: collaborative and competitive agents

--> End-to-end projects: autonomous assistants, chatbots, planners

ðŸ§  Tech Stack
Python, LangGraph, LangChain

OpenAI / Anthropic / Hugging Face APIs

Vector stores: Qdrant, FAISS, ChromaDB

Optional UIs: Streamlit, FastAPI
